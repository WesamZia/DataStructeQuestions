# DataStructeQuestions

A list of interesting Data structure related question with a suggested solution that i have come up with or stumbled upon ,
that i hope to help programmers in preparing for their technical interview, or just for the fun of it ,
if any one out there enjoys solving such questions as a hobby like me . 

I have used clean code princeble and C# coding standards while doing so and provided some unit test so i could practice the right coding procedures as an example as well .
