Am working into putting a list of interesting Data structure related question with a suggested solution that i have come up with or stumbled upon ,
that i hope to help programmers in preparing for their technical interview, or just for the fun of it ,
if any one out there enjoys solving such questions as a hobby like me . 

i will be useing clean code princeble and C# coding standards for the code , N-tier for the soultion architicture , while doing so with some unit test so i could practice the right coding procedures as an example as well in this project.
